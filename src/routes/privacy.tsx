      <Section title="Who we are">
        MrsANONymous.org is a free safety and support service for women and girls experiencing or
        surviving domestic violence. We are not an emergency service.
      </Section>

      <Section title="What we collect">
        <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-1">
          <li><strong>A nickname and password.</strong> We never ask for your email, phone number, or real name.</li>
          <li><strong>Security question answers</strong>, stored only as one-way hashes so we cannot read them.</li>
          <li><strong>Anything you write or record</strong> in your notebooks, including voice recordings and files you attach.</li>
          <li><strong>An anonymous session identifier</strong> in a cookie, used to remember your reactions and blocks.</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section title="What we never collect">
        <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-1">
          <li>Your location is never sent to us. If you use the emergency location feature, your device shares it directly with the emergency service you contact.</li>
          <li>Saved addresses and your safety plan are stored only on your own device — they are never sent to us. When you text an emergency service, your phone's own messaging app sends it directly.</li>
          <li>No advertising identifiers, no third-party ad networks, no analytics profiles, no data brokers.</li>
          <li>We never sell or rent any information about you.</li>
        </ul>
      </Section>

      <Section title="How your writing is used">
        Notebooks are private by default. A notebook appears on the community board only if you choose to
        share it, and you decide whether it shows your nickname or "Anonymous". You can unshare or delete
        it at any time.
      </Section>

      <Section title="Translation">
        If you switch languages, the text on screen may be sent to Google Translate to be translated.
        Do not rely on translation for anything you consider secret.
      </Section>

      <Section title="Mascot app guidance">
        Guidance conversations are saved privately in your account until you delete them or delete
        your account. Only your account can access them through the app; they are not posted to the
        board or sent to the support inbox. Your questions and the conversation history are sent
        through Lovable AI to an AI provider to generate replies. The selected provider endpoint
        uses zero data retention. The mascot does not read your notebooks, recordings, saved
        addresses, or safety plan. Do not enter names, addresses, or other identifying details.
        AI guidance can be mistaken and is not emergency, medical, or legal assistance.
      </Section>

      <Section title="Deleting your account">
        You can permanently delete your account and everything in it at any time from{" "}
        <a href="/settings" className="text-rose-600 underline">Settings</a>. Deletion is immediate and
        cannot be undone.

      <Section title="Children">
        Our "Girls" section is written for teens. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
        children, and we require no personal information from anyone.
